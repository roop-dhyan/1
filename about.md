This website is a repository of divine pictures that make me love Prabhu more, create a infusion of emotion in my heart and my mind and take me more closer to the infinite bliss, that is Shri Krishna.

I am Vikas Srivastava. I maintain this website by the grace of Prabhu. I don't claim the copyright of the images. This website is for non-commercial use.
